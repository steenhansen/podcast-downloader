## Podcast-Downloader for Windows 7+This desktop program downloads podcast episodes onto your computer be they MP3s, PDFs, MP4s, or images. The rationale for this program is that some podcasts disappear when hosting is cancelled. And some podcast feeds, such as [The Joe Rogan Experience - libsynpro.com](http://joeroganexp.joerogan.libsynpro.com/rss) with 1,400+ episodes, only have the last 248 episodes listed on iTunes. For example the episodes listed on  [The Joe Rogan Experience - iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-joe-rogan-experience/id360084272)  currently spans only from #1,212 to #1,460.Moreover, the program also tests that an RSS feed points to the correct files. This can be tried by downloading [The SFFaudio Public Domain PDF](https://sffaudio.herokuapp.com/pdf/rss) RSS feed which contains 6,000+ files.The program was developed with the open source [Lazarus-IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/). There is both a normal Windows program and a console version. The OpenSSL files libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll must be in the same directory as the EXEs, (without them some HTTPS RSS feeds, such as  [NASA's Image of the day](https://www.nasa.gov/rss/dyn/lg_image_of_the_day.rss) which contains images like [this](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/iotd.html), will fail).The project contains [tests](https://github.com/steenhansen/podcast-downloader/tree/master/the_tests),[dependency instructions](https://github.com/steenhansen/podcast-downloader/blob/master/compile-info/gui-podcast-downloader-dependencies.png),[compile options](https://github.com/steenhansen/podcast-downloader/blob/master/compile-info/compile-options.png), [class information](https://github.com/steenhansen/podcast-downloader/blob/master/compile-info/var-types.txt), and [debugging information](https://github.com/steenhansen/podcast-downloader/blob/master/compile-info/debug-server.png).![GUI version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steenhansen/podcast-downloader/master/lib/gui-downloader.png)![Console version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steenhansen/podcast-downloader/master/lib/console-downloader.png)The console version has no search capabilities, every podcast episode will be downloaded to a folder on the desktop. Click the 'Download' button in the lower right hand corner to [download](https://github.com/steenhansen/podcast-downloader/blob/master/podcast-downloader-exes.zip) both the  console and GUI EXEs.   #### Created by[Steen Hansen](https://github.com/steenhansen) using the open source cross-platform [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) ide on Windows 10.
