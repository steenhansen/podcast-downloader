﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿# Podcast-Downloader for Windows 7+This program downloads podcast episodes onto your computer be they MP3s, PDFs, MP4s, or images. The rational for this program is that some podcasts disappear when hosting is cancelled. And some podcasts, such as [The Joe Rogan Experience - libsynpro.com](http://joeroganexp.joerogan.libsynpro.com/rss) with 1400+ episodes, only have the last 248 episodes listed on iTunes. The episodes listed on  [The Joe Rogan Experience - iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-joe-rogan-experience/id360084272)  currently spans #1212 to #1460.Moreover testing that your RSS feeds also point to the correct files can be trying as with [The SFFaudio Public Domain PDF Page](https://sffaudio.herokuapp.com/pdf/rss) which contains 6000+ files.The program is developed with the open source [Lazarus-IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/). There is both a normal Windows program and a console version. The OpenSSL files libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll must be in the same directory as the EXEs or some RSS feeds, such as  [NASA's Image of the day](https://www.nasa.gov/rss/dyn/lg_image_of_the_day.rss) which contains images like [this](https://www.nasa.gov/rss/dyn/lg_image_of_the_day.rss), will fail.## Created by[Steen Hansen](https://github.com/steenhansen)
